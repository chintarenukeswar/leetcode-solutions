Item1: Consider static factory method instead of constructors
    Advantages:
    a: One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have names.
        In cases where a class seems to require multiple constructors with the same signature, replace the
        constructors with static factory methods and carefully chosen names to highlight their differences.
    b: A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors,they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked
    c: A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors,they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
    d: A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.
        Example: EnumSet. based on
    e: A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written.

Item 2: Consider a Builder when faced with many constructor parameters
Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type
